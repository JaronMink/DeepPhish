## Profile Materials

This folder contains the following profile materials:

- **full\_profile\_examples**: This folder contains screenshots of full profiles as they are presented to participants during the main study. Profiles are divided by occupation and artifact condition. *Note: The specific images and names shown are not held constant but are from the pools of names and images included in this repo (see section 3.2 and 3.3 for details)*
- **profile\_images**: This folder contains the three pools of profile images used to populate the profiles in the main study. Images are organized into pools based on the three possible image artifact conditions (consistent, intra-field, and inter-field). Each image pool contains 30 images (15 male images and 15 female images).
- **name\_lists**: This folder contains the list of gender-neutral first names and last names used to populate the profiles in the main study. 
- **interaction\_examples**: This folder contains screenshots of possible user interactions with all profiles. During the study participants are able to expand the profile image and expand the experience section. *Note: the experience section is hidden until user's interact by expanding it.*
- **sybil\_profiles**: This folder contains screenshots of the additional sybil profiles as they are presented to participants during the followup study. *Note: Unlike the other profiles, these are examples of real sybil accounts and thus the image and text remain static for each profile (see Appendix B for details).*
- **README.md**: This file.
